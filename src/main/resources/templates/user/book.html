  <h1>BOOK CONTENT: HERE</h1>
  <p>
    "ludicrously entertaining" (Time), Public Enemies is the story of the most spectacular crime wave in American history,
    the two-year battle between the young J. Edgar Hoover and his FBI, and an assortment of criminals who became national
    icons: John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barkers.
    In an epic feat of storytelling, Burrough reveals a web of interconnections within the vast American underworld and
    demonstrates how Hoover's G-men secured the FBI's rise to power.
